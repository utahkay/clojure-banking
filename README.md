# banking

A Clojure concurrency exercise

Up and Running
-------
* Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
 * Put shell script/batch file somewhere on your path 
 * Run lein self-install
* Create new project
 * lein new banking
* In the created banking folder there is a project.clj. Edit project.clj to add "test-refresh" plugin for continuous test.
 * add :plugins line as follows

```clojure
(defproject banking "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]]
  :plugins [[com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh "0.1.2"]])
```

* At the command line cd to your new project folder (banking)
* lein test-refresh


The Problem
-------

Create functions to credit, debit, and transfer between bank accounts. They must not be vulnerable to race conditions.

For example, if two threads try to credit the same account at the same time, the account balance must eventually be correctly incremented by BOTH credit amounts.

Concurrency in Clojure
-------

Concurrency support is built into Clojure. This exercise will cover **atoms** and **refs**.

* Atoms

blah blah

* Refs
